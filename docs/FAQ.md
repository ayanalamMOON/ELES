## üìä Using the Simulator

### How do I start the simulation?

There are three ways to use E.L.E.S.:

1. **Web Interface (Recommended):**

   ```bash
   streamlit run ui/streamlit_app.py
   ```

   Then open <http://localhost:8501>

2. **Command Line Interface:**

   ```bash
   python cli/main.py asteroid --diameter 2 --density 3000 --velocity 20
   ```

3. **Python API:**

   ```python
   from eles_core.engine import Engine
   engine = Engine()
   result = engine.run_simulation('asteroid', {'diameter_km': 2.0})
   ```

### What event types are supported?

E.L.E.S. supports 6 extinction-level event types:

- **‚òÑÔ∏è Asteroid Impact** - Size, density, velocity, target type
- **ü¶† Global Pandemic** - R‚ÇÄ value, mortality rate
- **üåã Supervolcanic Eruption** - VEI scale, volcano selection
- **üå°Ô∏è Climate Collapse** - Temperature change magnitude
- **üí´ Gamma-Ray Burst** - Distance from Earth
- **ü§ñ AI Extinction Risk** - AI capability level

### How do I interpret the severity scale?

The severity scale ranges from 1-6:

1. **Minimal Impact** - Local effects only
2. **Local Disaster** - City/regional impact
3. **Regional Catastrophe** - Multi-state/province effects
4. **Continental Crisis** - Continent-wide impact
5. **Global Catastrophe** - Worldwide effects
6. **Extinction-Level Event** - Threatens human survival

### Can I use custom parameters?

Yes! All event types support custom parameter input:

- **Asteroid**: Diameter (0.01-50 km), density, velocity, target type
- **Pandemic**: R‚ÇÄ (0.5-10.0), mortality rate (0.1%-50%)
- **Supervolcano**: VEI level (4-8), volcano selection
- **Climate**: Temperature change (-20¬∞C to +20¬∞C)
- **Gamma-Ray Burst**: Distance (100-10,000 light-years)
- **AI Extinction**: Capability level (1-10 scale)

### Are there preset scenarios?

Yes! E.L.E.S. includes historically-based presets:

**Asteroid Presets:**

- Tunguska (1908): 60m asteroid
