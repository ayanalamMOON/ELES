# 2km Metal Asteroid Impact Scenario
scenario_name: "2km Metal Asteroid Impact"
description: "Large metallic asteroid similar to the one that caused dinosaur extinction"
event_type: "asteroid"
severity_estimate: 6
historical_context: "Similar to Chicxulub impact 66 million years ago"

parameters:
  diameter_km: 2.0
  density_kg_m3: 8000
  velocity_km_s: 20.0
  impact_angle: 45.0
  target_type: "continental"

expected_outcomes:
  crater_diameter_km: 35
  impact_energy_j: 6.7e21
  tnt_equivalent_mt: 1600000
  immediate_casualties: 10000000

notes: |
  This scenario represents a catastrophic asteroid impact that would likely
  cause mass extinction. Based on the asteroid impact that killed the dinosaurs
  but adjusted for modern population density and infrastructure.
