# Toba Supervolcano Eruption
scenario_name: "Toba-like VEI-8 Eruption"
description: "Supervolcanic eruption similar to Toba 74,000 years ago"
event_type: "supervolcano"
severity_estimate: 6
historical_context: "Toba eruption may have reduced human population to 3,000-10,000"

parameters:
  name: "Toba"
  vei: 8
  magma_volume_km3: 2800

expected_outcomes:
  ash_volume_km3: 5600
  ash_cloud_height_km: 50
  temperature_drop_c: 10
  cooling_duration_years: 8
  pyroclastic_flow_range_km: 300
  immediate_casualties: 200000
  global_population_bottleneck: true

notes: |
  The Toba eruption created a severe volcanic winter and may have caused
  a population bottleneck in early humans. A similar event today could
  threaten human civilization.
