# Distant Gamma-Ray Burst
scenario_name: "Distant Gamma-Ray Burst"
description: "Gamma-ray burst from star beyond 3000 light-years"
event_type: "gamma_ray_burst"
severity_estimate: 2
historical_context: "Regular occurrence with minimal Earth impact"

parameters:
  distance_ly: 5000
  duration_seconds: 30
  energy_erg: 1e44

expected_outcomes:
  ozone_depletion_percent: 10
  uv_radiation_increase: 1.2
  mass_extinction_probability: 0.1

notes: |
  Distant gamma-ray bursts occur regularly and cause minimal direct damage
  to Earth. May damage satellites and cause minor ozone depletion.
