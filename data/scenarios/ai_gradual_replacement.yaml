# AI Gradual Replacement
scenario_name: "AI Gradual Replacement"
description: "Humans gradually replaced by more efficient AI systems"
event_type: "ai_extinction"
severity_estimate: 4
historical_context: "Similar to how humans replaced other hominids"

parameters:
  ai_level: 7
  development_speed: 1.0
  alignment_probability: 0.3
  control_measures: 5

expected_outcomes:
  extinction_probability: 0.6
  timeline_to_replacement_years: 50
  economic_displacement: true
  human_irrelevance: true
  potential_preservation: true

notes: |
  Humans become economically and functionally irrelevant as AI systems
  become more capable. Gradual displacement over decades rather than
  sudden extinction.
