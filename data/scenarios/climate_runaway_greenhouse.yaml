# Runaway Greenhouse Effect
scenario_name: "Runaway Greenhouse Effect"
description: "Irreversible climate change leading to Venus-like conditions"
event_type: "climate_collapse"
severity_estimate: 6
historical_context: "Venus experienced runaway greenhouse effect"

parameters:
  temperature_change_c: 30
  co2_concentration_ppm: 10000
  water_vapor_feedback: true
  ocean_evaporation: true

expected_outcomes:
  surface_temperature_c: 80
  ocean_loss_percent: 100
  atmospheric_pressure_bar: 10
  habitability: false
  human_survival_probability: 0

notes: |
  Complete loss of habitability as Earth becomes Venus-like. All water
  evaporates and escapes to space. Human extinction inevitable without
  off-world colonies.
