# Nearby Gamma-Ray Burst
scenario_name: "Nearby Gamma-Ray Burst"
description: "Gamma-ray burst from star within 1000 light-years"
event_type: "gamma_ray_burst"
severity_estimate: 5
historical_context: "May have caused Ordovician extinction 450 million years ago"

parameters:
  distance_ly: 1000
  duration_seconds: 10
  energy_erg: 1e44

expected_outcomes:
  ozone_depletion_percent: 75
  uv_radiation_increase: 10
  mass_extinction_probability: 0.8
  recovery_time_years: 100000
  affected_hemisphere: "facing"

notes: |
  Gamma-ray burst would strip away ozone layer, causing deadly UV radiation
  to reach Earth's surface. Would trigger mass extinction through ecosystem
  collapse.
